//: # How to access code in the *Sources* folder
/*:
 In this playground, many pages use the same code, and playgrounds support this with a *Sources* folder for common code.
 However, I cannot find a way to link to files in that folder.
 So, to look at those files, follow these instructions:
 
 If you are running on a Mac:
 
 Under the *View* menu, select *Navigators*, then *Show Project Navigator*.
 In the left-hand colum, find a folder icon labeled *Sources* and click
 the disclosure triangle on its left so that it points down.
 Then, you can select the file in *Sources* that you want to see.
 
 If on iOS:
 
 Tap on the three small circles at the top right of the screen to get the *Tools* menu.
 Then tap on the *Advanced* item in that menu.
 In the *Advanced* menu, tap on *View Auxilliary Source Files*.
 On the left of the screen, tap on *Sources*.
 Then, you can select the file in *Sources* that you want to see.
