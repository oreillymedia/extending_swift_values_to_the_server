/*
 If you are here then you are probably looking for code in the "Sources" directory.
 I cannot figure out how to directly link to that code in Xcode 8 playground markup,
 so here are instructions:
 
 If you are running on a Mac:
 
 Under the View menu, select Navigators, then Show Project Navigator.
 In the left-hand colum, find a folder icon labeled 'Sources' and click
 the little triangle on its left so that it points down.
 Then, you can select the file in Sources that you want to see.
 
 If on iOS:
 
 Tap on the Tools menu at the top right of your screen. (The icon is three small circles.)
 Then tap on the 'Advanced' item in that menu.
 Tap on the "View Auxilliary Source Files" item in the "Advanced" menu.
 On the left of the screen, tap on the word "Sources".
 Select the file in Sources you want to see.
