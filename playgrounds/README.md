As of 11/6/16, the playgrounds are rough, but they work on both Mac and iPad.
At present, to get them onto your iPad, you'll have to download from github,
then airdrop to the iPad.

Although working, these are still very rough. I will be cleaning them up.

Also, these playgrounds do not exploit all the UI possibilities.
They do not use buttons and custom views.
But, they do demonstrate the examples in the book.

The code departs from the text in minor ways in order to work better in a playground.
